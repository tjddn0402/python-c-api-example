# My Python C Extension Module
This repository contains a simple example of a Python extension module written in C. The purpose of this module is to demonstrate how Python can interact with C, and to provide a template for creating your own Python extension modules.

## Structure
- mymodule.c: This file contains the C code for the extension module. It defines a single function square that takes an integer as input and returns the square of that number.

- mymodule.pyi: This file provides type hinting for the mymodule extension. It helps linters and type checkers understand the type of the square function.

- setup.py: This file is used to compile the mymodule.c file into a shared object file that can be imported into Python.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
```bash
cd yourrepository
```
3. Compile the C extension module:
```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
4. The compiled .so file should now be in your current directory and can be imported into Python.

## Usage
To use this module in Python, simply import it as you would any other module:

```python
import mymodule
result = mymodule.square(4)  # result will be 16
```

## Note
This module is a simple demonstration and is not intended for production use. It does not include error checking or other robustness features that would be needed for a production-ready Python extension module.

## Future Work
In the future, we plan to extend this module with additional functionality and to provide more robust error checking. If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
